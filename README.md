# Bridge-Analysis-Project
This code was created to analyze the forces of shear and momentum that occur over a beam bridge when a train passes over it, and then it was used to calculate through different iterations the optimal cross-sectional shape of the bridge based on out limited materials, alongside with calculating what is the maximum force allowed on the train before yielding, which the program precisely predicted.
To represent the shear and momentum, matplotlib was used to plot the maximal force along the bridge, this is considering the train is moving from end to end, and has both a case in which its weight is even, and other in which is assymetrical.
### Personal comment
This is a long file for what it is, because this was one of my first projects in Python and because I was not aware of the many iterations we would have to go through I didn't create the proper global variables, and I understand now that it would've been much more efficient if made in a different way.
And finally this code was made to interpret for our design, but it still completely open for you to change the numbers and play around with it.
